Week 2:

Week two was mainly research for both my major project and my essay. I started off by deciding how I am going to carry out my research and how I am going to gather resources and made the decision that I would use three different tools – [https://littleelefantblog.tumblr.com/ ](Tumblr), a physical sketchbook and this blog. I will mainly have images on my Tumblr and articles that I found useful, my sketchbook is printed resources and sketches of my ideas and then this blog will be more detailed research that will help me with my essay and major project, as well as my weekly progress.

I have edited this post to say I had a bit of a disaster with Tumblr and I don’t know how I managed to mess up, however now having to add all my content again due to a bit of a mix-up between second year and final year content.

I started to look at essay topics that I could focus on that would help me with my major project idea. Some of my ideas are:

*  What is the impact of bad design?
* Why it is vital that we design for the end user?
* The paperless office
* Can bad design kill?
* Is bad design frustrating or deadly?

I went on to research different books and resources that could help me with my essay and came across the following that I found useful:

* [Tragic Design: The True Impact of Bad Design and How to Fix It by **Jonathan Shariat**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/149192361X/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A7CL6GT0UVQKS)

This week was mainly reading and researching, but I left with a solid idea of what I am doing and had a list of various articles that could help me with my essay.
