Week 6 â€“ Presentation and Essay Deadlines

This week was the mid semester presentations to allow our lecturer to get a better idea of where we are within our project. The presentation was to last 10 minutes and cover what you had done so far. I spoke about the reason for my project and why I feel it is useful, the user research that I carried out and the problems that people currently have with healthcare and communication, competitors, pricing and my business model and then my timeframes of what I will do throughout the rest of the semester. My feedback was mainly positive and I feel that I am heading in the right direction with my project.

This week was mainly focused on the presentation and completing my essay proposal that was due on the Friday. I completed my essay early to give me a few days to read it over again and make any changes I felt necessary.
