Competitors
===

Competitor’s within the care sector offer a range of different services. I started to look at various digital systems and narrowed it down to systems that handle the care of residents and ease pressure on staff. I also looked at competitors within the childcare sector.

[Sekoia Care](http://www.sekoia-care.co.uk/ "Sekoia Care")
---

Sekoia is a digital information tool for homes that work on touch screen devices that are installed around the home. They recommend that they be installed in the resident’s rooms. They market that the use of their system results in fewer mistakes, easier logging of observations, which results in greater job satisfaction for the care staff. It offers more than 30 apps within the program that can be customised to suit the specific care homes needs. Their software is marketed for nursing homes, not for care in the community.

**What Are the Features?**

* **Tasks** - you can tick off tasks are they are completed and send notifications if something, such as medications, are not given on time.

* **Appointments** - Gives staff an overview of appointments and activities for each resident which enables staff to ensure they attend all appointments. There is also the option for residents to access the calendar themselves and register for events that take place within the home

* **Recording Incidents** - Enables staff to record incidents such as falls and seizures without having to leave the resident

* **Ordering Supplies** - Care staff are able to order products directly from the system to prevent incorrect or duplicate orders and takes away the need for the admin team to take care of them

* **Collaborate with colleagues** - Allows care staff to easily share responsibility for residents highlighting who may require help

* **Recording measurements** - Enables healthcare information to easily be recorded, such as blood pressure, weight, food intake and fluid intake

* **Instructions** - Pictures and videos can be uploaded to show staff how they can complete different tasks. This allows new staff to learn things quickly

**How It Works and How It's Set Up**

Sekoia works by installing touch screen devices into nursing homes. They recommend that the screens be inserted into the resident’s rooms. They state that the system can be used by anybody within the care home, such as nurses, care assistants, administration and residents.

You can select the applications that you want. You do not need to buy the full system if you would only like a certain amount of features. Sekoia focuses a lot on a hands on training approach providing a member of the Sekoia team to be on-site to train and support staff. They state on the website that the system will only go live when every member of the care team are ready and they will be withyou "at every stage of this journey". They state that staff can be trained on how to use the system within 2 hours.

> "During the implementation process we train up two kinds of users for your home. There are normal users, such as carers, who can be trained to use the platform in only two hours. We will also train senior managers to be ‘Super Users’ – the on-site experts who can help other staff members if they encounter a problem, or train new and temporary staff."


**How Do They Market the Product?**

Sekoia uses [animated videos](https://player.vimeo.com/video/194316127) to explain how their system can help the daily routines within a nursing home. The videos break the system down and show how care assistants and administrative staff can use the system.

Sekoia has a [news](http://www.sekoia-care.co.uk/news/) section on their website that works like a blog on healthcare explaining about different things within the world of healthcare and also talking about their products. Another thing that they use to promote their system are [case studies](http://www.sekoia-care.co.uk/cases/) that explain how their system has impacted various care homes. They do not use social media to promote their software.

**Pricing Information**

I cannot get information on Sekoia's pricing.

[My Nursery Pal](https://www.mynurserypal.com/index.html)

My Nursery Pal is an application that allows staff to enter information that parents can log on and have access to. This is what I am hoping to achieve with my system, although with the healthcare sector as the main focus. There is very little information on their website, and only one screen of the system therefore I am unable to get much information.

Conclusion
---

Throughout looking at competitors I realised that childcare has a strong focus on communication with parents, family and guardians regarding how a child is doing and their progress. There are many applications out there that are focusing on healthcare although I feel that they have missed the link with communication with family and friends. The information that the healthcare applications are holding is useful, although I feel that it is all over the place and there is a strong focus on text making it very difficult in the case of an emergency to get the information that you need quickly and easily. The busy interfaces are confusing and as someone who was a care assistant I feel overwhelmed and unsure about what a system does
