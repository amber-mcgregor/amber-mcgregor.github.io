![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/native_vs_web.png)


I wanted to explore the different benefits of using a web or native application for my care application. I wanted to gain better understanding of what would be best suited for my application and the pros and cons of each to allow myself to make the choice that's best suited.

### What is a Native Application

A native application, or native app, is an application or a program that have been developed specifically for a certain platform or device. Native apps work well as they are built for a specific platform therefore they benefit from all the features. A native app is installed directly onto a device and separate apps are created for each device.


### Pros of a Native Application

* Higher quality applications

* Native apps work with the device's built-in features

* Marketing tools are better, and feedback is retained and tracked courtesy of the app store

* They perform faster on the device, especially if the app requires service side APIs

* They have to be approved by an app store therefore reassured that it is safe and secure to use

* You can send push notifications


### Cons of a Native Application

* More expensive to develop

* You need an app for each platform, iOS and Android

* Cost of app maintenance and updates cost more

* Users need to update the versions to maintain the application


### What is a Web Application

Web apps are developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, alongside a programming language that enables functionality. A web application is accessed through any browser.


### Pros of a Web Application

* Easier to maintain, only one code base that works on multiple devices - making it more cost effective

* Compatible with nearly all devices

* No need to get approval from an app store

* No restrictions on when the app can be released, as you are not waiting on an app marketplace

* No need for users to update an app


### Cons of a Web Application

* Offline storage can be an issue

* You cannot send push notifications

* Developing a web app that works on different mobile browsers can be expensive, as you need to develop and maintain them

* Different users will use different mobile browsers, therefore making it difficult to record usage patterns and provide support for all variations.

* Web apps are more difficult to find than a native app

* The lack of quality control means that web apps may not have a high level of safety and security


### Conclusion

Originally I intended to create a web application as I felt that it was more beneficial to have an application that can be accessed from any device. I decided that I should look into the different options in more depth to get a better idea of the pros and cons of each. After doing this I decided that it would be best if my application was a native app rather than a web based application. I think that notifications would drastically improve communication to the friends and family side.

I think that it is important to note that you are able to set up tablets so that only one application can be used; this is called [Kiosk Mode](https://www.bouncepad.com/us/knowhow/lock-ipad-tablet-kiosk-mode/). This would be useful for the likes of nursing homes, and also promote people to bring their own device that they can use in care in the community.

The costs may be higher for developing an application that is native, however, I feel that the pros out-weigh the cons and it would be far more beneficial for a native app to be developed.
